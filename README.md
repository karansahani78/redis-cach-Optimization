# redis-cach-Optimization

# Overview
redis-cache-Optimization is a project aimed at improving the performance of caching systems using Redis. The main goal of this project is to optimize how data is cached and retrieved from Redis, ensuring faster response times and reduced server load. This repository contains code and configurations to efficiently manage Redis caching with a focus on improving application performance.

# Features
Redis Caching: Utilizes Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load and speeding up data retrieval.
Optimized Data Access: Implements various strategies to optimize Redis caching, including TTL (Time-To-Live) management, cache invalidation, and efficient key management.
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle large-scale applications with high throughput.
Spring Boot Integration: Integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot applications for easy configuration and usage.
Installation
# Prerequisites-->
Before setting up this project, make sure you have the following installed:

Java 11 or later
Redis Server (local or remote)
Maven or Gradle (for building the project)
# Steps to Install -->
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/karansahani78/redis-cach-Optimization.git
# Build the Project:

-->If you're using Maven:
mvn clean install

If you're using Gradle:
gradle build
# Set Up Redis: Make sure your Redis server is running. You can start Redis on your local machine or use a cloud-hosted Redis instance.

For local installation, you can refer to the official Redis installation guide.
Configure Redis in Application: In the application.properties (or application.yml) file, configure the Redis connection details:
# proprties
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379
spring.redis.password=your_redis_password  # Optional if Redis requires authentication
Run the Application: Once Redis is set up and the application is configured, you can run your Spring Boot application:

mvn spring-boot:run
Or with Gradle:
gradle bootRun
# Usage
This project provides caching functionality for commonly accessed data. To use the Redis cache, simply annotate your service methods with @Cacheable to cache results:

@Cacheable(value = "notes", key = "#id")
public Note getNoteById(String id) {
    // Database query or expensive operation
}
To clear the cache, you can use the @CacheEvict annotation:


@CacheEvict(value = "notes", key = "#id")
public void deleteNoteById(String id) {
    // Delete note from the database
}
Cache Optimization Techniques
1. TTL Management:
Set an expiration time (TTL) for cached data to ensure that stale data doesn't persist indefinitely.
Example:

@Cacheable(value = "notes", key = "#id", unless = "#result == null", ttl = 300)
public Note getNoteById(String id) {
    // Query logic
}
